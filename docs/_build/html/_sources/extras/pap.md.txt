1.) Requirment

[gh issue, close when test passes, link to test issue]

We will collect requirments. For most of the requiment we will be able to descibe an excample in a "fudged" protbuf file.


2.) Test cases

for tgsi requirment [gh issue, link to requiment issue, link to test_ file and class/function inside, close when test passes]

We will wriet a pytest test or some test to make sure that each version of out project is houting teh requiments

We will add a feature to one of out test protobuf escample test files


3.) Code

Write code

Add Commnet to Requment issue


4.) Test

test for green

--------

5.) First Simple prototype:

Python:
a.) open a given ascii file in a dir

b.) parse Filename and set meta data

c.) parse file content and set further meta data as well as (mostly) events with a time and additional values

d.) Write meta data and data into ProtoBuf file

e.) maybe also safe meta data in local database (TBD/TBC)

f.) end


6.) write Makefile to execute pytest tests
