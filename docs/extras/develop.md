### Note on Shields

[![Dependencies](https://img.shields.io/librariesio/release/github/cruisen/cli-calc)](https://libraries.io/github/cruisen/cli-calc)

1. [flake8-commas](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-commas),
   one of the development plugins of the
   [wemake-python-styleguide](https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-python-styleguide)
   is marked as *No Maintenance Intended*.
   See this
   [Issue](https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-python-styleguide/issues/2276).
   Most probable *wemake* will replace this dependency with a fork.

1. [python 3.7](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0537/#and-beyond-schedule)
   is deprecated.
   However some dev tools are still dependant.
