## Dealing with change [requests]
>"For each desired change, make the change easy (warning: this may be hard), then make the easy change"
from [Kent Beck on Twitter](https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/250733358307500032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E250733358307500032%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmokacoding.com%2Fblog%2Fhow-to-choose-what-to-refactor%2F)

## Manifests
Following these rules, which basically reduce our possibilities, 
we enable ourselves to write maintainable software. They build upon each other.
